## how to start?
1. use `git clone ` to local.
    ```
        git clone git@github.com:StephenHuge/My8Puzzle.git
    ```
2. My IDE is Eclipse, `file` -> `import..`, then choose this project's directory.
3. get `/src/my/puzzle/controller/Game.java`, `run as Java Application`.
4. use key `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT` and `RIGHT` to control, try to get numbers sorted ascending. Just enjoy it.
## Other Words
There are still some problems, if you find some, I will sincerely appreciate it.
